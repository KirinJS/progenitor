# progenitor

A project builder using templates and substitutions.

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install progenitor`

    ./bin/cli.js --template commonjs --dest $destination_dir

## Documentation
There are a number of other templatized project generators out there. Almost all rely on being able to hand-write the template.

``progenitor`` is designed to have templates generated by other wizards.

It is also designed to be embedded.
